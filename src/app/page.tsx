          New Leaf is committed to providing safe, forward-thinking environments

          our developmental programs are experimental in nature and remain under
          restricted clearance until official publication. Sharing of internal

Participants were selected for their adaptability and emotional
neutrality, then subjected to controlled reconditioning to remove
prior biases and memories. The goal was to observe whether a
personâ€™s moral compass could be entirely reconstructed under
monitored environments, allowing for perfectly obedient and
efficient behavioral outcomes.`}
